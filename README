PyCGB stands for Python codes for comparative genomcis of Bacteria. This Python package aims to provide a pipeline for conducting comparative genomics analysis of Bacterial genomes at a large scale, say, >200 genomes.
The main modules include:
1. Prokka annotation
2. antiSMASH annotation
3. Pangenome analysis
4 KEGG pathway prediction and Deep annotation of unknown genomics elements
5. Integration of annotated results
6. Prediction of community life style
